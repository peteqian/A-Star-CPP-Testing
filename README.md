# CSIT314
CSIT314 - Unit Testing

# Installation 

The program can be executed using VSCode using Windows 10.
In order to execute test cases, you must install the following pre-requisites:

1. CMake and CMake tools via VSCode
2. C/C++ (VSCode Extension)

If you encounter errors with CMake. Ensure your settings are correct, check main page of CMake via VSCode. 
Or, alternatively download from https://cmake.org/ and install into directory you can locate.

Install MinGW Version 8.1.0 [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win32/Personal%20Builds/mingw-builds/installer/mingw-w64-install.exe/download)

Add to user environment variables PATH the ```~/path/to/your/compiler/bin``` folder and ```~/path/to/your/cmake/bin``` folder. Ensure both are added.

Check your CMake and compiler has been installed.

```cmake --version```

```g++ --version```

# Build set-up.
## Windows

1. Download and install CMake
2. Select a CMake kit with a compiler of your choice. This may be mwing/Visual Studio 2019 x86/x64 architecture.
3. Once you've downloaded CSIT314 Folder from the repos
4. Build
5. Make/Play (Play button in VSCode)

If you encounter errors with building. My only solution so far is to reconfigure your compiler with another C/C++ compiler.

Create TestCases within ```../test/SimTests.cpp```

Documentation of test case creation can be found [here](https://google.github.io/googletest/).

## Unix (Mac OSX, Ubuntu)
1. Download and install CMake
2. Configure CMake with your default gcc compiler. Clang for Mac OSX and GCC x86_64-linux-gnu for Ubuntu 20.04.
3. Once you've downloaded CSIT314 Folder from the repos
4. Create a build directory 
> mkdir build
5. Change to build and make
> cmake ../ && make

# Running your tests
1. Firstly, ensure the file you're working must include in the headers:
> #include "../ass3-refactor.h"
> 
> #include <gtest/gtest.h>
2. Do not re-declare, as compiler will complain. Technically, this shouldn't need to be be declared at all. It is automatically generated within the libraries.
> int main(int argc, char **argv)

## Windows
1. The executable of the test program is built in ```build/test```. Program READS from build/test directory for any TEST DATA.
2. The files in the home directory are just for static test data to remove annoying randomness involved in generating the test data for debugging the test case functionality. This should not be tested in the final production.
3. If you're working VSCode, there is a play button on the bottom.

## Unix
1. Ensure you have saved your source code files.
2. Run the make command in the build directory
> $ cd ./build && make
3. For any test data, the program DOES NOT READ from ```build/test``` directory for any TEST DATA AND MUST READ FROM ```build/```
3. Then run the program
> ./build/test/SimTests

## Making changes to the source code.
For the actual program, the source code is located in ass3-refactor.cpp and ass3-refactor.h.
As for the test cases. You can either separate your test cases into a new file in the home/test/ directory or work in an existing file. Preferably separate test case for code readability.

When creating a separate file for tests. You must:
1. Edit the ```CMakeLists.txt``` located in the test folder 
> CSIT314/test/CMakeLists.txt
2. Then edit on line 5 to add your new file to ensure that cmake has linked the files and libraries together:
> set(Sources SimTests.cpp Data.cpp >insert_your_new_file_here<)
